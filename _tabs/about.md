Hi! I'm Florent Hospice Adjobignon MICHOAGAN, a cybersecurity professional passionate about offensive security but also defensive. With a Bachelor's in IT Security and a solid foundation from my CEH and OSCP certifications, I've recently advanced my offensive security skills with the OSEP certification.

This blog is my personal knowledge hub â€“ a place to consolidate what I learn, revisit complex topics, and share insights with the cybersecurity community. I'm always eager to dive into new areas of cybersecurity, continuously expanding my expertise.

> Keep exploring, for the world never runs out of wonders!
